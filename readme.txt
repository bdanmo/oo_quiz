This quiz app has yet to be expanded to include the UI workings of multiple
quizzes. I intend this be more of a web app than a webpage, so all of the action
will take place within the #quiz div in the HTML and by dynamically generated.
I plan to include an initial page to let the user pick their quiz, and buttons
at the bottom of the "quiz completed" pages to let the user go on to the next
quiz, or go back to the main page.
