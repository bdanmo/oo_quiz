To run: download repo and open index.js in your browser. No server needed.

To edit the quiz: open app.js and pass your own questions into the quiz0 array using the Question() constructor. The Question constructor receives three arguments: Question[string], answer options[array of strings], correct answer[index value of correct answer in the answer optionsarray]

This quiz app has yet to be expanded to include multiple
quizzes. 

I intend this to ultimately be more of a multiple quiz web-app, built on express, Pug, and Vue.js.

I would like to include an initial page to let the user pick their quiz, and buttons
at the bottom of the "quiz completed" pages to let the user go on to the next
quiz, or go back to the main page.
