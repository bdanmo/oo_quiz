This quiz app has yet to be expanded to include multiple
quizzes. 

I intend this to ultimately be more of a multiple quiz web-app, built on express, Pug, and Vue.js.

I would like to include an initial page to let the user pick their quiz, and buttons
at the bottom of the "quiz completed" pages to let the user go on to the next
quiz, or go back to the main page.
