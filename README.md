# quizApp
# An object-oriented quiz app that is meant to be easily expanded to include 
# more quizzes, and simple to implement in the app.js file.
#
# This quiz app has yet to be expanded to include the UI workings of multiple
# quizzes. I intend this be more of a web app than a webpage, so all of the action
# will take place within the #quiz div in the HTML and by dynamically generated.
# I plan to include an initial page to let the user pick their quiz, and buttons
# at the bottom of the "quiz completed" pages to let the user go on to the next
# quiz, or go back to the main page.
#
# My intent with this project is to get comfortable with some of the more
# complex operation of object-oriented javaScript before moving on to study
# node.js and the various JS frameworks.
